# -Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-via-Haar-Cascade-Eye-Tracking
Driver Drowsiness Detection via Haar Cascade Eye Tracking is a real-time safety application that uses OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifier to detect and track the driver’s eyes through a webcam. The system continuously monitors eye closure duration, and if the eyes remain closed beyond a predefined threshold, it triggers an audible or visual alert to warn the driver. This lightweight solution can run on laptops or embedded devices like Raspberry Pi, making it suitable for in-vehicle deployment to help prevent accidents caused by fatigue.
